INSTALLATION
============

This file lists the steps to install the DRC plugin for your Eclipse software. It assumes that Eclipse is already installed on your system. The plugin has been succesfully tested with Eclipse version 3.8 (Indigo).

The directory DRC-plugins, on the desktop, contains five .jar files. These files together compose the DRC plugin. To install the plugin, copy these five files to the dropins folder of your Eclipse installation. On this machine, this folder is located at:

	/home/vagrant/work/eclipse/dropins/

Then run Eclipse from a shell by giving the following command:

	eclipse -clean

This will force Eclipse to clean its caches before starting. Once Eclipse starts, you will be able to see a new option 'Eref' in the Show View dialog. From there, you can run this tool on any PHP project to detect dangling references.


The jar files for the plugin are also available to download from a GitHub repository: https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos/ICSE-2013-DRC
